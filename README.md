# SMU-Project-1-MaryJane
This repository contains Team 2's work for project 1. Each team member was assigned a hypothesis and folders are broken up accordingly to show the code.
Shanara's folder contains the final report and presentation slides.

For Project 1, Team 2 analyzed a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consisted of various datapoints on legal cannabis. Hypothesis were divided out among team members as follows:

Hypothesis 1 (Misha),
Hypothesis 2 (Kimberly),
Hypothesis 3 (Lattiana),
Hypothesis 4 (Tacha),
Report/Presentation/QC/Coded with other team members (Shanara)

In light of the expanding legislation and discussions where cannabis is at the forefront, Team 2's research brought about several critical questions highlighting the multi-faceted ways where cannabis could have an impact. For example, what societal, economic, or health implications are at play when states decide to resist the legalization of cannabis? How does the dynamic between breeders and their consumers change or evolve in states where cannabis is recreationally  and/or medicinally legal vs. states where it is currently up for debate? The goal of addressing these questions is to understand the various government, industry, and societal perspectives that has made cannabis use more appealing in our contemporary society.

The original dataset is titled, “Cannabis Strains.” The contents contained within this particular dataset included the name, type, rating, effects, taste, and descriptions. The main goal during the data cleaning process, once the raw data was pulled, was to preserve enough information to maximize the reliability of support for the findings. Team 2 refined the data columns and extracted breeder information from the description section resulting in a robust amount of information comprised of 2351 rows that were used to examine and interpret the validity of our hypothesis and research questions. Using the clean and final dataset as a guide, four hypotheses were generated, all serving as focal points helping to unravel the informational diversity and formulating key insights found throughout the dataset.
