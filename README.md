This repository contains Team 2's work for project 1. Each team member was assigned a hypothesis and folders are broken up accordingly to show the code.
Shanara's folder contains the final report and presentation slides.

For Project 1, Team 2 analyzed a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consisted of various datapoints on legal cannabis. Hypothesis were divided out among team members as follows:

Hypothesis 1 (Misha),
Hypothesis 2 (Kimberly),
Hypothesis 3 (Lattiana),
Hypothesis 4 (Tacha),
Report/Presentation/QC/Coded with other team members (Shanara)

The original dataset is titled, “Cannabis Strains.” The contents contained within this particular dataset included the name, type, rating, effects, taste, and descriptions. The main goal during the data cleaning process, once the raw data was pulled, was to preserve enough information to maximize the reliability of support for the findings. Team 2 refined the data columns and extracted breeder information from the description section resulting in a robust amount of information comprised of 2351 rows that were used to examine and interpret the validity of our hypothesis and research questions.

Using the clean and final dataset as a guide, four hypotheses were generated, all serving as focal points helping to unravel the informational diversity and formulating key insights found throughout the dataset. The four hypotheses explored were: Do hybrid types have more happy effects compared to non-hybrid types? Does the sweet flavor cannabis have the highest ratings? Do the breeders with the highest count of unique strains have the highest average ratings? Is there a significant difference in ratings by type or ratings by effects? With these hypotheses as our guide, our thesis statement for the project was to analyze a cannabis-related dataset, including information on various factors such as type, flavors, mood, effects, and user ratings to gain comparative insights related to the production and consumption of cannabis.
