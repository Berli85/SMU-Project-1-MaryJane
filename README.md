# SMU-Project-1-MaryJane
This repository contains Team 2's work for project 1. Each team member was assigned a hypothesis and folders are broken up accordingly to show the code.
Shanara's folder contains the final report and presentation slides.

For Project 1, Team 2 analyzed a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consisted of various datapoints on legal cannabis. Hypothesis were divided out among team members as follows:

Hypothesis 1 (Misha): Do hybrid types have more happy effects compared to non-hybrid types?
Hypothesis 2 (Kimberly): Which flavor has the mean, min, and max values? Which effects have the mean, min, and max value?
Hypothesis 3 (Lattiana): How does the breeder location impact its rating and the type of grown in that location?
Hypothesis 4 (Tacha): Is there a significant difference in ratings when users experience the same effects while consuming a different cannabis type?     
Do users feel different effects when they use the same type of cannabis? 
How does this influence the effects rating?
